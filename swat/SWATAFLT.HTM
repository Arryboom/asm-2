<P>Have you ever been puzzled by some CPU fault as to why it occurred,
that is, why did the CPU think there was a problem?&nbsp; If so, this feature
is for you.&nbsp; Whenever 386SWAT is called on the difficult to figure
out CPU faults (TSS Fault, Stack Fault, GP Fault, or Page Fault), the Autofault
feature attempts to determine why and to present a short prose description
of the cause.&nbsp; The description is displayed in the lower lefthand
corner of the screen. Pressing a key causes the message to disappear.&nbsp;
To display it again (up to the time another fault occurs), press <A HREF="swatscr.htm#s-F4">s-F4</A>.

<P>This feature is implemented for GP, TSS, and Page Faults, although they
all could use more tweaking.&nbsp;<!--#include virtual="/footer.htm" -->
