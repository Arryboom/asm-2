<P>At times you need to browse through some code (sometimes it's even your
own code) following subroutine calls, conditional jumps, etc. wherever
they might go. To make this task easier, use the <A HREF="swatscr.htm#s-F1">s-F1</A>
and <A HREF="swatscr.htm#s-F2">s-F2</A> keys. To disassemble at the target
of some instruction which transfers control, place the instruction at the
top of the disassembly window and press s-F1. For example, say at offset
<TT><FONT SIZE=+1>1234</FONT></TT> in the code segment there is a <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>CALL
5678</FONT></TT>. Place the <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>CALL</FONT></TT> at the top
of the disassembly window and press s-F1. The disassembly window now displays
the code at <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>5678</FONT></TT> with an invisible bookmark
left at the calling address <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>1234</FONT></TT>. Each time
s-F1 is used, it leaves a bookmark at the instruction at the top of the
disassembly window and disassembles at that instruction's target. To return
to the previous bookmark, press s-F2.&nbsp; 386SWAT supports up to 128
nested levels of such disassembly.

<P>As another example, you should be able to disassemble almost any interrupt
(say, <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>U .VMI21</FONT></TT> which disassembles at VM interrupt
21h), and using the bookmark feature exclusively, go down to the bottom
of the chain.

<P>This feature is clever, but not that clever. It can figure out where
(say)<TT><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></TT>

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JMP Dword Ptr CS:[1234]</FONT></TT>

<P>is going and disassemble at that target, but it can't figure out the
same instruction with a <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>DS</FONT></TT> override. Nor
can it handle effective addresses other than ones with an immediate displacement
only (i.e., no registers such as <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>[BX+SI]</FONT></TT>).&nbsp;<!--#include virtual="/footer.htm" -->
