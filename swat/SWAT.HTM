      <p>This protected mode debugger provides debugging services to real mode, 
        protected mode, virtual 8086 mode programs, DPMI and VCPI clients, and 
        Win 3.1x and Win95/98 programs under any memory manager while occupying 
        only a few kilobytes of low DOS memory. 
      <p>It supports disassembly of the full 386, 387, 486, Pentium, and Pentium 
        Pro CPU instruction sets through the Pentium MMX &amp; SSE instructions. 
      <p>This debugger is also a Windows Kernel Debugger providing low-level Windows 
        debugging services a la WDEB386, but residing in the same machine, so 
        no COM port hookup is needed. To take advantage of this feature, you must 
        have a separate video adapter (PCI or ISA monochrome) and matching monitor 
        attached to your system. 
      <p>This program started out in early 1988 as an internal tool in Qualitas 
        to help write and debug 386MAX, but has matured into a significant program 
        in itself (the executable is over 400 KB generated from over 3MB of 386 
        assembly language source code). As it stands now, 386SWAT can debug almost 
        any 
      <ul>
        <li> Real Mode (RM)</li>
        <li> Virtual Mode (VM)</li>
        <li> VCPI- or DPMI-based Protected Mode (PM), and</li>
        <li> Windows 3.1x and Win95/98 program. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although 386SWAT was written to debug 386MAX, it can also intrude into 
        the PL0 context of other memory managers as well so as to function as 
        a PL0 debugger there. It also can debug programs remotely (over a modem) 
        and can display source code instead of just disassembly instructions, 
        along with many other features. 
      <p>I'd be interested in getting some feedback from you as to how useful 
        386SWAT is as well as how I can improve it.
      <p>Questions or comments, please e-mail the author at <a href="mailto:bsmith@sudleyplace.com">bsmith@sudleyplace.com</a>, 
        or perhaps you'd like more detailed <a href="swatdoc.htm">documentation</a>, 
        or just jump right in and <a href="../download.htm">download</a> it.
